## The Basics of Chess
{: style="text-align: center;"}

“Chess is a finite, two-player, zero-sum, perfect-information game.” - [Sora](https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=no-game-no-life-2014&episode=s01e01)

In Chess players take turns moving pieces on a board to capture the enemy king and win the game. Luck plays no part in chess and the games are won by skill, intuition, and foresight.

## My Dataset

My dataset is from the user [Mitchell J on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) This dataset was created using the Lichess API and collecting data from multiple users. The dataset contains 20058 games played by humans of varying strengths. The dataset has plenty of information for research including, but not limited to, both of the player’s ID, both player’s ELO score, the results of the match, the moves that were made, and the opening ECO code for the game.

## Exploring the Dataset

In total there were 9107 wins by black, 950 draws, and 10001 wins by white. This means that Player 1 as white has an approximate 9.8% higher win ratio than Player 2 as black.

Of the top 10 openings in the dataset, the highest win rate for white was the B00 ECO code, and the highest win ratio for black was B20.

The ECO code B00 is: pawn to e4

The ECO code B20 is: pawn to e4, pawn to c5

This goes to show that Black can respond to whites moves and so long as each player had sufficient knowledge and skill the game goes back and forth. Remember Chess is a zero-sum game and anytime a player gains the other player loses an equal amount. There are 400 moves on the first full turn alone and not one of those 400 moves is capable of capturing a piece.

## Conclusion
{: style="text-align: center;"}

In the dataset, white seemingly does not have an advantage. The benefit felt by the players as white is very likely tied to the speed of being set up one move earlier. However, in getting setup first, black’s players have a better ability to respond to opposing moves given enough skill or pattern recognition.
